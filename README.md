## Development server

Run `npm run start-dev` to start the dev server. Make sure to first include a `.env` file in the root of your project with the required values or startup with fail. Development also requires running [XIV Raid Hub](https://github.com/smithk58/xiv-raid-hub) to see the UI. May also require [XIV Raid Hub Bot](https://github.com/smithk58/xiv-raid-hub-bot) if you're touching functionality that requires the bot, such as alarms.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Lint

Run `npm run lint` to run the projects linter.

## Environment Variables
Put these values in a [`.env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) file or feed them in as environment variables to the project however your hosting platform supports it. 
* `NODE_DEV` = Set to`development` when doing development, otherwise can be ignored.
* `APP_SECRET_KEY` - A large random key, used for securing cookies.
* `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` - The OAuth2 client ID for a [discord app](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Will be used when authenticating users for this application via discords oauth.
* `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` - The secret for the above ID.
* * Be sure to add this applications auth URL to your discord applications redirects in the oAuth section. Otherwise discord will not let you
authenticate (e.g. `https://<your-prod-domain>.com/connect/discord/callback`, or `http://localhost:3000/connect/discord/callback` for development).
* `DATABASE_URL` - A full postgres connection string (e.g. postgres://{username}:{password}@{hostname}:{port}/{database}).
* `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_PORT` - Connection information for a postgres DB for the application via separate variables.
* `BACKEND_BASE_URL` - The base URL for the backend (e.g. `http://localhost:3000` for local dev, or `https://<your domain>.com` for production).
* `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` - Only needs to be set when doing local development with your frontend in its own webserver.
* `BOT_BASE_URL` - The base URL for the bot. Only needed if doing operations that must talk to the bot. (e.g. set to `http://localhost:3001` for local dev, or https://<your bots domain>.com for production).
* `XIV_RAID_HUB_BOT_API_KEY` - A valid API key for the bots API. Only needed if running/interacting with the bot locally.
* `FFLOGS_CLIENT_ID` - A valid FFLogs API client ID. Only needed for features that interact with the FFLogs API (e.g. getting expansions, zones, reports).
* `FFLOGS_SECRET` - The secret for the above ID.
* `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` - Restricts webservers allowed origins. Only applied when in production mode. Expects a JSON array of origins (e.g. ["https://www.xivraidhub.com", "https://bot.xivraidhub.com"]).
* `SYNCHRONIZE_DB` - Decides whether the DB is automatically created/maintained on startup. Is automatically enabled in development, but only should be enabled in production for the initial startup.

## For Development
You can paste the below snippet in a `.env` file in the root of your project. This should never be committed. You must fill in the missing values and/or delete any values that aren't needed for your local development.
```
NODE_ENV=development
APP_SECRET_KEY=<large random key, used for securing cookies>
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=<your discord client app id, required to login/get a session>
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=<your discord client app secret, required to login/get a session>
FFLOGS_CLIENT_ID=<your fflogs client ID, if your using fflogs related features>
FFLOGS_SECRET=<your fflogs secret, if your using fflogs related features>
BACKEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
FRONTEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4200
BOT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
XIV_RAID_HUB_BOT_API_KEY=<the API key you set in the bots environment variables, required for features that interact with the bot>
DATABASE_URL=<db connection URL, required for the backend to function at all, also can specify with the separate DB variables>
```

### For Production
You should run the project in production with a docker image generated by this project, but it should also run fine as a node project via `npm run build` and `npm run start`.

The required variables for either way can be found under the Docker Image section.

### Docker Image

You can build a docker image by running `docker build -t xiv-raid-hub-api .` on the root of the project.

After building an image, you can test it locally with the below steps:
* Add a `.env` file under root with the following content:
```
APP_SECRET_KEY=<app secret>
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=<valid discord client ID, assuming you want to be able to login>
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=<valid discord client secret, assuming you want to be able to login>
FRONTEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4200
BACKEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
BOT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
XIV_RAID_HUB_BOT_API_KEY=<valid bot API key, assuming you want to connect to the bot>
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:4200", "http://localhost:3001"]
PORT=3000
<DB_HOST, etc., or DATABASE_URL>
```
* Run the following command from the root of this project `docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env xiv-raid-hub-api`.
* After executing docker run the server should be available. You can combine it with these similar steps with the frontend project to see the results.

### FFLogs GraphQL Stuff
If you run into issues with FFLogs related queries the `schema.graphql` file may be outdated. The file is defined/maintained by FFLogs, so the one saved in this codebase could become outdated at any time.

I use a plugin (GraphQL) to fetch it using the information in the `.graphqlconfig` file. If you do something similar you will first need to replace `<token>` in file with a valid token. Information on obtaining a token can be found in the FFlogs docs: https://www.fflogs.com/api/docs

If you update the `schema.graphql` file be sure to run `npm run fflogs-types` to regenerate the typescript type definitions (`fflogs-types.d.ts`) as well.
