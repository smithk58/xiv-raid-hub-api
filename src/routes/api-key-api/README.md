## API Key API

All these end points are accessible to someone with a valid API key and allow the requesting of information that isn't scoped to a logged in user (e.g. you can request a raid schedule for a particular user, without being that user, whereas the API the rest of the site uses requires a session, and scopes all requests to stuff specific to the logged in user).

These are pretty much just here for the xiv-raidhub-bot to hit for now, but can possibly be exposed to others in the future.
